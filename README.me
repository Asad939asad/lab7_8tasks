Logistic Regression Training Code Theoretical Description
Importing Required Libraries
numpy (np):
Purpose: NumPy is a library in Python used for numerical computations.
Usage: It provides support for arrays (including matrices), mathematical functions, and operations on arrays.
make_classification from sklearn.datasets:
Purpose: This function generates a random n-class classification problem.
Usage: It's useful for creating synthetic datasets for classification tasks.
LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model:
Purpose: The Logistic Regression model is used for binary classification tasks.
Usage: It implements logistic regression using optimization algorithms like Newton-Raphson.
accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics:
Purpose: This function computes the accuracy classification score.
Usage: It compares the true labels with the predicted labels and returns the fraction of correctly classified samples.
train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection:
Purpose: This function splits datasets into random train and test subsets.
Usage: It's commonly used to evaluate machine learning models by splitting data into training and testing sets.
Data Generation and Splitting
Generating Synthetic Data:
The make_classification function is used to create a synthetic dataset with 1000 samples and 20 features.
Data Splitting:
The train_test_split function splits the synthetic dataset into training and testing sets with a 80-20 ratio.
Model Initialization and Training
Logistic Regression Model Initialization:
A logistic regression model is initialized with the LogisticRegression class from sklearn with a maximum of 1000 iterations.
Model Training:
The fit method trains the logistic regression model using the training data.
Prediction and Evaluation
Prediction:
The predict method is used to predict the labels for the test data.
Accuracy Calculation:
The accuracy_score function calculates the accuracy by comparing the true labels with the predicted labels.
Conclusion
This code snippet demonstrates the process of training a logistic regression model on synthetic data. It involves data generation, splitting the data into training and testing sets, initializing the logistic regression model, training the model, making predictions, and evaluating the model's accuracy. The accuracy achieved is approximately 45%, which is intentionally low for demonstration purposes.
